## Status
_This is an alpha work in progress_
* `historicalDataRequest` is working
* `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` is working via a threaded async class that does not take over your REPL. 


## NB TODO
* Describe how to subscribe - remember only one field each time


## Description
Bloomberg provides native APIs for Python, Java, C#, and C++. This project aims to provide a Python-based gRPC server that can be used by any gRPC-capable programming language to access the Bloomberg V3 API. 
This project also allows access to the API from any operating system, including Linux and Mac, by running the server in a Windows VM, or by running WSL.
Supports:
* Bloomberg Terminal API.
* Historica APIs (`//refdata`) for ticks, bars, and daily closes. 
* Streaming APIs (`//mktdata`, `//mktbar` services). Subscribe to data, Excel-style, with push updates.  
* Most common session options. 
* Protocol buffer `.proto` files usable by any programming language that has a gRPC implementation.
Does not currently support:
* Bloomberg's Bpipe product, which requires the authentication subsystem to be implemented.

## Quickstart
The Bloomberg API is only available from Windows, so the server must be run from Windows. 
You cannot move data off machine, according to the Bloomberg API terms. Therefore if you're using this code from a Mac or Linux, you will need to ensure all operating systems are VM'd on the same machine.  

#### Server
1. In a Microsoft Windows shell, Clone this repo and `cd gRPC`. 
2. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. In the `src` directory you will find `server_gblp.py` which is your server. 
4. You need the IP address of the machine running the Bloomberg Terminal. Get it with `ipconfig`.
5. First you must generate a CA authority and keys: `python server_gblp.py --grpchost <your_ip> --gencerts`
6. Then you can start the server: `python server_gblp.py --grpchost <your_ip> --grpcport 50051`

#### Client
An example Python client is provided which will say hello a few times and run a sample `historicalDataRequest`.
It is also located in the `src` directory. Now you can be on a mac, on Linux, WSL, wherever. Naturally, 
you will need access to the IP address of your server. 
1. In a shell on your client machine, clone this repo and `cd gRPC/src`. 
2. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the client: `python client_gblp.py --grpchost <your_ip> --grpcport 50051`



## Installation
_todo_
`pip install gBLP` or
`nix develop`


## FAQ
* Why not REST?
    * The Bloomberg API uses the concept of "correlationIDs" to link requests with responses, which are a natural fit for gRPC function calls. 
    * REST doesn't do streaming. 
    * gRPC will marshall types across languages. 
    * Automatic binary serialization and deserialization. 
    * Faster.
* Why not Websockets?
    * Websockets are not a natural fit for request <-> response patterns. 
    * Avoids having to write a custom protocol.
    * Types, serialization as per REST.
* Can I use this if I don't have a Bloomberg terminal?
    * [No](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74503768/122792), unless you have a subscription to Bloomberg's Bpipe product. 
* Why not use FFI to C++
    * FFI with C++ is a pain in many languages, and would be Windows only. Now you can WSL. 
* I don't like Windows / WSL.
    * Bloomberg Terminal is Windows only, and does not permit data to be moved off the Windows instance it is running on.
    * Bloomberg has a number of (expensive) products which will allow data to move -- consult your Bloomberg representative about this. 
 


## Dependencies
This is the server component of the gRPC client <-> server pairing. It is a python package and depends on Python 3.10+

## Clients
_todo_
* Elixir
* Swift
* Javascript
* Roll your own
    * Use the proto files with the protocul buffers compile `protoc` (see [here](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)) to generate function stubs for your programming language.
    * Note that you will likely have to install a `protoc` plugin. Here fore example is the [plugin for Elixir](https://github.com/brexhq/protobuf-elixir). Here is Elixir's [gRPC library](https://github.com/elixir-grpc/grpc)
