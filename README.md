## What?
A gRPC server that wraps the Bloomberg V3 API. 


## Why?
* Streaming: a fully featured subscription API that operates in a separate thread, allowing REPL or Jupyter interactivity.
* Multi-language: gRPC allows you to use the same API in any language that supports it. 
* Blpapi on Linux, MacOS, or Windows (see the licence).
* Robust gRPC based API mapping with almost total coverage of the Bloomberg API. 


## Status
* Beta, but 90% of what 90% of users need is working.
* Python only client for now, but feel free to look at the [proto files](protos/bloomberg.proto).
* Elixir, Swift, and Typescript are next, in that order. Priority to REPL-friendly languages. 


## What's working

* Subscription subsystem. Unlike most api libraries, this one supports live data. 
* HistoricalDataRequest. Daily or longer periodicity data. 
* IntradayBarRequest. Minute or greater bars.
* IntradayTickRequest. Tick data.
* ReferenceDataRequest. Information on any security. 

## Not yet
* instrumentListRequest
* curveListRequest
* govtListRequest
* FieldListRequest
* FieldSearchRequest
* FieldInfoRequest

## Installation
clone repo
`cd gBLP`
`python -m pip install poetry`
`poetry build`
`python -m pip install gBLP --extra-index-url https://blpapi.bloomberg.com/repository/releases/python/simple/`  
Generate security certificates with the following command.   
`server_gblp --gencerts --grpchost <server_ip_or_hostname>`  
Here `localhost` is fine if you're staying on Windows on the same VM or machine, but otherwise you should use an IP address that is reachable from your client.  
Later you can `server_gblp --delcerts` to remove the certificates, or `--gencerts` to regenerate them.  
Done. You can now run the server and client.  

## Usage
#### Server. 
In a Windows cmd or powershell terminal run  
`server_gblp --grpchost <server_ip_or_hostname>`  
where `<server_ip_or_hostname>` is what you specified when generating the certificates on a machine with a Bloomberg Terminal.

#### Client
From a python REPL or script, on Windows, on WSL, or in a Linux VM, run the following code. This will not work if `<server_ip_or_hostname>` is not reachable from your client. Use `ping <server_ip_or_hostname>` from the client to check.
```
from gBLP.client_glp import Bbg
bbg = Bbg(grpc_host="<server_ip_or_hostname>")
test_hist = bbg.historicalDataRequest(["AAPL US Equity", "USDZAR Curncy"], ["PX_BID", "PX_ASK"])
```
Note that the client is threaded and will continue to allow you to use python/IPython while it runs. 
When you're done, `bbg.close()` will close the connection and clean up server side. Once closed, you cannot use the client again without reinstating it. 

#### Client Methods
* `historicalDataRequest`
* `intradayBarRequest`
* `referenceDataRequest`
* `sub`
* `unsub`
* `subscriptionsInfo`
Note that `sub` is a _live_ subscription. `bbg.sub(["XBTUSD Curncy"])` will populate the `bbg.subsdata` decque continuously.  
You may specify your own handler. See the examples.
